     the mission progressed, we eventually found ourselves in an all-out magical donnybrook against Harry's archnemesis Draco Malfoy, who (along with his cohorts) challenges Ron to a fight. As the fight began, the AI-controlled Ron began hurling his own spells at Malfoy's crew. Although we couldn't do it here, in most any situation where AI-controlled versions of Harry's friends are around, you'll be able to switch between the characters on the fly. This will be especially useful, since each character has his or her own particular strengths and abilities when it comes to combat and puzzle-solving. Hermione, for example, is smaller than Harry and Ron, so she can fit through tight spaces and can walk upon thin layers of ice, whereas Ron possesses something of a sixth sense that gives him the ability to see otherwise hidden doors and panels. Also, each character has his or her own unique spells that will come into play during combat, such as Hermione's freeze spell.<P1>
    <H1><strong>Intro scenario </strong></H1>
    <p1>    Harry Potter's  third year at Hogwarts starts off badly when he learns deranged killer Sirius Black  has escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage wizard. While Hermione's  cat torments Ron's sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. A mysterious new teacher helps Harry learn to defend himself, but what is his secret tie to Sirius Black? </p1>
